*Beta Builds are versions i am working on that may or may not work and may cause problems with your system or internet so use at your own risk.

*All other builds are stable enough for use by anyone without any known problems.

# Things to do:
- [x] Release usable script.
- [x] Add ping test.
- [ ] Implement new tweaks.
- [ ] Add customization options.
- [ ] Combine Windows 8.1 and under and Windows 10 into a single script file. (Either .ps1 or .bat) 

hopefully this happens before reaching V1.0
