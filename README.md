# Internet Speed Tweak script by: thepcwiz101

A batch script on windows that attempts to improve internet connection speed.

Notice: This may not work or it may actually slow your connection speed depending on your configuration and internet speed. If you have 
very high internet speed this script is not for you as it may not be beneficial to you but feel free to try at your own risk.

This is a long time project that i have worked on over the years. Now that i am out of school i have way more time to continue with my projects.

Current stable version: V1.1 "Simplifying" update

Any changes of the script are welcome as long as it improves the script.
