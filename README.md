# Internet Speed Tweak script by: thepcwiz101

A batch script on windows that attempts to improve internet connection speed.

Notice: This may not work or it may actually slow your connection speed depending on your configuration and internet speed. If you have 
very high internet speed this script is not for you as it is not beneficial.

This is a long time project that i have worked on over the years. Now that i am out of school i have way more time to continue with my projects.

Current stable version for windows 10: V0.3

Current stable version for windows 8.1 and under: V0.2

Current beta version for windows 10: No beta released

Current beta version for windows 8.1 and below: No beta released

*All other builds are stable enough for use by anyone without any known problems.

# Things to do:
- [x] Release usable script.
- [x] Add ping test.
- [x] Implement new tweaks. (If Microsoft adds new options file an issue.)
- [ ] Combine Windows 8.1 and under and Windows 10 into a single script file. (May keep seperate as I no longer support older operating systems)
